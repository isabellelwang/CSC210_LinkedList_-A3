Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
Phase 1 to 3 was relatively smooth as I was able to understand the concepts. However, for phase 4, the algorithms for splice by copy and the transfers were particularly challenging. However, the challenge of trying to figure out how the splices/slices and copy/transfers helped me better understand how these concepts work and the algorithm they follow. I also was able to better understand linkedlist and nodes and how it is much more efficient in some cases than ArrayList. Originally, I was using the list class within the SLL<T> which defeated the purpose of creating a new list class. However, I found it much easier to not use the list class inside SLL<T> as I would have to keep track of the list and the connection of nodes.
